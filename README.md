## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this social links profile and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to: 

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I didn't learn anything special. I already had the basics for this challenge. Of course, there's always room for improvement. But I'm still proud to have completed this challenge, because it's another step towards achieving my goals, and it has an impact on my reward system, my motivation and the positive dynamic I want to maintain.

### Continued development

I haven't yet taken the step of using the BEM methodology for my css and I haven't yet found the perfect transition for the buttons on the hover.
